# Finance overview estimaition

**Estimating cost to AAC Solutions of development and upkeep of the cloud access service**

## Development 
1. AAC Solutions
- Standard rates
2. External developer
- 500 to 1000 AUD
- See Matthew for contact 

## Ongoing ~
1. Cloud DB and Cloud VPS
- $10 Monthly account
- Talking to sales about cost for server costs, looking at around $30-$60 a month
- Could run server internally at AAC 
2. Occassional tweaks and config changes by AAC Solutions Technicians 

## Setups at venue ~500
1. RPI or NUC
- ~500 AUD
2. Labour
- Standard price


**The following prices are estimations only**
## INITIAL DEVELOPMENT 
### = or >$2000 (research and development cost) 
## COST PER SETUP OF CUSTOMER 
### = > $500 (billed to customer) 
## ONGOING MAINTAINENCE (billed to us) 
### = > $100 a month 

## Customer Charge Per venue (billed to customer after initial setup cost) 
### = > $50 a month 

## ROI 
### ROI = 
Yearly AAC Cost (no included setup as Setup cost billed to customer) - Revenue(Revenue per customer X number of customers)
```
Cloud + Per year = $1200

Monthly bill($75) X Customer amount(100) = 7500

The more clients that are connected, the more the revenue, at a $75 monthly bill it would require a minimum of 16 clients to cover cloud cost.
Not including initial software development costs, all hardware and setup costs are billed to client and are not included. (such as a NUC for proxy conneciton)
Further cost reductions can be discovered when usage data is collected such as CPU usage to find more cost effective hardware.
