## Introduction
PulseLive.cloud is an optional add on service to PulseLive which allows a venue manager to connect to their venue remotely, anywhere in the world (so long as you have an internet conneciton). 
This is all done without a VPN or changing your network settings. All of the remote access is handled by AAC Solutions' cloud server. 

## Features
1. HTTPS Secure connection
- Your venue data outside of the network is encrypted and safe from anyone listening in. 
3. User Management
- Request us to set up more users at your discretion
- Only you can access your venue 
5. Multi venue connection
- If you are a manager of multiple venues you can connect to multiple servers with our front dashboard.

## Prerequisites
- As a user you are only required to have a web browser which supports TLS2 and TLS3
- (Any modern browser such as a recently updated Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Brave, TOR, and Opera should work fine) 

## Installation
- All installation is carried out by AAC Solutions
- Technicians to auto deploy with docker and SSH in using their private keys in order to add configurations
- If you have a pre-existing PulseLive server dont worry, all we need to do is add a small PC on your network and create an open port to that PC only.

### Technician notes 
- Configuration DBMS managed via python configurator to SQL

## Usage
- Simply go to the address which we specify in our setup documentation and login with your one time password.
